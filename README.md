### üß† **Core Topics Covered**

1. **Introduction to Data Cleaning**
   - **Situation**: Handling raw data that often contains missing, duplicate, or inconsistent values.
   - **Task**: Understand and prepare data for machine learning or decision-making processes.
   - **Action**: Learned to use tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn to identify issues.
   - **Result**: Improved data quality, making it ready for analysis.

2. **Tools and Libraries**
   - **Situation**: Data analysis and visualization require robust libraries.
   - **Task**: Use Python libraries to simplify data preparation.
   - **Action**: Employed Pandas Profiling for exploratory data analysis, Missingno for visualizing missing data, and Sidetable for value frequency insights.
   - **Result**: Automated insights into data issues, reducing manual efforts.

3. **Handling Missing Values**
   - **Situation**: Missing data can disrupt machine learning models and analytics.
   - **Task**: Identify and address missing values effectively.
   - **Action**: Applied techniques such as removal, imputation, and modeling missing values.
   - **Result**: Datasets became complete and usable for modeling.

4. **Duplicate Data**
   - **Situation**: Duplicates can bias results and inflate datasets.
   - **Task**: Identify and handle duplicate rows effectively.
   - **Action**: Used Pandas' `duplicated()` and `drop_duplicates()` methods to analyze and clean duplicates.
   - **Result**: Ensured unique entries, enhancing dataset accuracy.

5. **Outliers and Data Normalization**
   - **Situation**: Outliers skew statistics and model performance.
   - **Task**: Detect and address outliers.
   - **Action**: Used interquartile range (IQR) and Z-scores to identify and manage outliers. Applied normalization and encoding for numerical and categorical data.
   - **Result**: Balanced datasets, reducing distortion in analyses.
